# HTML Starter
This is my personal HTML starter boilerplate. It uses common tools such as node, gulp, jQuery etc. It's tailored to fit my needs but feel free to us it.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

You can now run `gulp watch` for development or just `gulp` for production.

Happy coding!
